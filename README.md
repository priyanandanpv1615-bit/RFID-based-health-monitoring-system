# RFID-based-health-monitoring-system
 Developed an IoT-based system to measure vitals using sensors and ESP8266, with RFID  authentication for secure, real-time data access.
An automatic vitals measuring system will be set up with the help HW826(Pulse sensor), DS18B20(Body temperaturesensor).
This system will be connected to an ESP8266 to store anddisplay data.
Authorised RFID tag will be used to access this data and display.
Setting up this automatic vitals measuring system will help the medical industry have an ease in operation.
